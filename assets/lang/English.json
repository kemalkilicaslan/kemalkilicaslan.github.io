    "bio": "I am Kemal, I live in Ankara, Turkey. I graduated from Kastamonu University, Department of Mathematics in 2022 with a GPA of 2.8/4. Currently, I am focusing on improving my technical skills in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and image processing by applying the knowledge from my mathematics background. To achieve this, I am exploring AI algorithms through personal projects, online courses, and practical applications specific to image processing in line with my interest. These projects include tasks such as image detection, recognition, and interpretation. Through this hands-on work, I gain experience that helps me deepen my understanding of AI concepts and further develop my technical skills. My goal is to continue developing these skills and contribute to AI solutions in real-world contexts.",
